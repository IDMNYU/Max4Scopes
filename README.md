Example patches for working with (analog) oscilloscopes in Max/MSP/Jitter.

Step 1: Find yourself an [analog oscilloscope](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=analog+oscilloscope+working&_sacat=0&_odkw=analog+oscilloscope&_osacat=0) (Brüel & Kjær, Tektronix, etc.), 2-channel minimum with X/Y mode. *Do not get a "vectorscope" unless you find one that accepts unmodulated DC input voltages (hint: most don't).*

Step 2: Find yourself an audio interface with [DC-coupled outputs](https://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/which-audio-interfaces-are-dc-coupled/).

Step 3: Connect your computer to your audio interface and the outputs of the interface to the inputs of the oscilloscope. Most scopes use BNC / Coaxial inputs, so you might need an [adaptor](https://www.amazon.com/Pomona-1297-Adapter-Phono-Plug/dp/B06Y1HDSCS/) or a [funky cable](https://www.ebay.com/itm/225089604432). Remember to select your audio interface in the *Audio Settings...* in Max.

Step 4: Have fun.
